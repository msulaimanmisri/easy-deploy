## composer dump-autoload -o
Regenerates the Composer autoloader and optimizes it for performance.
* Why? Ensures any new classes or files added are properly loaded without performance overhead.
* Benefit: Faster class loading in production environments.


## composer install
Installs the dependencies
* Why? Downloads and installs the necessary libraries and packages defined in the `composer.json` file.
* Benefit: Ensures the application has all required dependencies to run correctly.


## php artisan migrate --force
Executes database migrations without requiring user confirmation.
* Why? Automates the migration process during deployment, applying database changes safely.
* Benefit: Ensures the database schema is always up to date with the codebase.


## php artisan clear-compiled
Removes the compiled class file used by Laravel.
* Why? Ensures Laravel uses fresh compiled files after deployment.
* Benefit: Prevents issues caused by stale compiled files during updates.


## php artisan optimize:clear
Clears all cached data in your Laravel application, including configuration, route, view, and application caches.
* Why? Simplifies the cache-clearing process by combining multiple cache commands (`config:clear`, `view:clear`, `route:clear`, etc.) into one.
* Benefit: Ensures the application runs with fresh cache files, preventing potential issues caused by stale or outdated caches while reducing redundancy in deployment scripts.


## php artisan optimize
Prepares the application by optimizing cache files for faster performance.
* Why? Combines and caches framework bootstrap files for better runtime efficiency.
* Benefit: Reduces overhead during application startup.


## php artisan config:cache
Creates a cache file for the configuration.
* Why? Boosts performance by loading configuration settings from a single, precompiled file.
* Benefit: Faster request handling in production environments.


## php artisan queue:restart
Restarts the queue worker processes.
* Why? Ensures that any changes to your codebase are reflected in the queue workers.
* Benefit: Prevents workers from running outdated code after deployment.
